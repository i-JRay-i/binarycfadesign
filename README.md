# Binary CFA Learning Algorithms

This repository includes binary CFA learning methods implemented in TensorFlow and PyTorch. The codework presented here contains various binary CFA learning algorithms used during my Ph.D. thesis.

Mainly there are four methods for implementing a binary CFA;

\item Weighted SoftMax
\item Normalized SoftMax
\item STE-aided Hard Thresholding
\item Regression Term Enforcement

Currently, this repository contains the first three methods in TensorFlow and the second and third in PyTorch.
